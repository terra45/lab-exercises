## Part 1: Debugging

my_num <- 6

initials <- "?. ?."

my_vector <- c(my_num, initials)

# run ?sum to get more info
vector_sum <- sum(my_vector)

# Describe why this doesn't work: 
#It does not work because you can't take the sum of a string of character and numbers

install.packages("stringr")

my_line <- "Hey, hey, this is the library"

print(str_length(my_line))

# Describe why this doesn't work: 
# This does not work because it forgot to add the 'stringr' package to the library

# Make a vector and use typeof to check what type R considers it to be                ???????

# Write a function `compare_length` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"
compare_length <- function(a, b){
  answer <- a - b
  paste0("The difference in lengths is ", answer)
}

# Pass two vectors of different length to your `compare_length` function


# Write a function `describe_difference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"

# Pass two vectors to your `describe_difference` function


# Write a function `combine_vectors` that takes in 3 vectors and combines them into one

# Send 3 vectors to your function to test it.

# Write a function `caps_time` that takes in a vector of names of courses you're taking, ex "Informatics 201" and removes all capital letters
